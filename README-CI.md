# Project 4 - CI Project
## Part 1 - Docker-ize It

### Overview
In this project, I am tasked to utilize Docker/DockerHub to create and develop a container that runs a given `angular-bird` application. I am also tasked with connecting this GitHub repository to a repository in DockerHub, and interacting with the two in order to edit the container and otherwise. Finally, I will identify how these tools interact with each other through diagramming.
### Application Containerization
This section discusses setting up Docker, building the container, and making/using a Dockerfile.
- How do you install Docker and its' dependencies on the required systems?:
  - On Windows, Docker can be installed from [Docker's Website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
  - Since I am also using Ubuntu as my (required) WSL instance, I will also have to `sudo apt install docker` so I can work with the GitHub repository locally.
- To build and configure a container without building an image...
  - We have an example application provided to use called `angular-bird` that contains a simple Angular application, and requires angular version 15.0.3 and Node.js version 18 to run.
- What instructions does the `Dockerfile` contain?:
  - t 
- How do you build an image using the `Dockerfile`?:
  - t 
- How do you run a container from the image build by the repo's `Dockerfile`?:
  - t 
- How do you view the application running in the container?:
  - t
